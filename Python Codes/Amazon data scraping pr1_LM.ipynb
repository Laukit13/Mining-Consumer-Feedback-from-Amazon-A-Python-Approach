      "['Used for sports in multi-tiered cakes. Easy to cut to size and no worries about having to wrap for food safety, or not getting back more expensive supports. Bright colors make them easy to identify when cutting and driving cake... as well as fun surprise for kid\\'s cakes. Very inexpensive option when compared to like items labeled as \"cake supplies\" in giving and craft stores. Highly recommend - just be careful to not order the bendy kind ;).', 'We keep these straws on hand to use with the boba packs from Costco. They are the perfect size for the boba to fit through, and the length is taller than a lot of other straws so they can be used in our insulated cups. They do not have the sharp point that some boba straws have which is safer for young kids, and little ones love the bright colors.', 'I purchased these straws for my smoothies because thin straws always get clogged up! They are just the right size and a good price for the quantity!', \"Long enough & wide enough for thick smoothies or milkshakes. And they're very colorful.\", 'The straws work great for smoothies and shakes.', 'So great that I had to order again.', '8mm is just the right size for most users... like the multicolors and length... service was quick...', 'We love these sturdy straws for our thick shakes!', 'My family loved this straws but I wish it could had brought more color on my package. Most of them were green and I had bought them for my baby’s rainbow birthday party.', 'Excellent straw for boba drinks. A slanted angle in one end would have made it easier to get through the lid but other than that it’s a great product.', 'The quantity worth the money I bought them already five times', \"I love these! They're the perfect size for my homemade slushies and smoothies. They also fit into my tumblr perfectly.\", 'Love the colors. Fun. Works well.', 'Love them. perfect for my protein shakes', \"My family loves to make shakes at night (not the healthy kind sigh) regular straws just weren't cutting it so I searched local stores and couldn't find anything. After searching Amazon I found a bunch of options but really liked the price and quantity of this selection. I chose the largest ones so I didn't have to hear complaints from the kids about the shakes being too thick, the straws work great but may be a tad too big.\", 'I got tired of trying to drink my morning smoothie thru a regular straw so I order these. That was a great decision. I can drink it quicker and get everyone out of my cup. A must buy if you make smoothies!!', \"Hey, they're great straws. I used them to make a huge wedding cake and they held up way too sturdily. I could've made a 10 ft. tall cake and these would've done fine. Nice long length--longer than the others and the best value.\", \"These aren't as tall as the others i've gotten but they absolutely are nice and durable. I put them in smoothies and acai bowls.\", \"Lately I've been a fat kid at home. And I've included my family along with it. Making all different kinds of Milkshakes. These straws are great! They don't collapse on you and you can fit larger chunks of shake mix through them. Whether it be brownie M&Ms pretzel or anything of the like.\", 'Nice sturdy straws. Bought them for cake supports and not drinking, but fit my purpose well :)', 'I’ve only used for water and a smoothie so far but they seem sturdy enough to withstand thicker drinks without caving in on you and colors are vibrant and fun. Will order again if still available when I need more!', 'Like yhe straws wide', 'Don’t be bamboozled by the title these straw are absolute mint. I can make a smoothie with the same viscosity of wet concrete and still be able to suck it through like a brand new Dyson vacuum. These won’t let you down, sea turtles can attest to their sturdiness. The vast color selection is an absolute perk when trying to match a strawberry banana smoothie with a contrasting yellow suck canon or a açaí blueberry with what is obviously a red coke straw. No mater what the intended purpose of these straws, when you get your hands on them you’ll be begging the seller to take more of your money.', 'These are the perfect support for layered cakes. They cut to size smoothly and hold a good amount of weight.', 'Perfectly boba sized, great mix of colors', 'Son de buena calidad', \"Just wasn't what I needed\", \"I make smoothies nearly every morning because I can drink them in the car on the way to work. The fruit doesn't clog up the straw when it isn't mixed up well.\", \"Ok they're just big straws - but I can use them in my Kale Smoothies !!! YAY\", 'Works great for my toddler', \"These are straws. Nice straws. Fat straws. The plastic a teeny bit on the thin side but they perform exactly as a straw should.*not individually wrapped, if that's important to you*\", '4th time I have reordered these straws. They are a good width, not too wide or too narrow, and description says they are recyclable.', 'They are identical to the straws IKEA used to sell. Not too long, not too narrow.', 'Good size, sturdy.', 'The bobas I bought do fit through the straw - but is a little bit of a tight squeeze', 'Perfectos para usar de soportes en los cakes', 'Great straws for milkshakes or smoothies!', 'Only straws I buy!', 'Really good straws. They are a heavy duty plastic and wide enough most other straws would slide through them.', 'Good size for thick smoothies.', 'Good Straws, have had them before', 'These work great for what I purchased them for. Unfortunately right after I purchased I found them cheaper at Kroger. But they did as described and worked perfectly', \"Large enough diameter to allow horseradish chunks to pass freely and strong enough not to collapse, especially after they've been submerged for a while. Paper is nice, but for this drink.\", 'These straws are very sturdy will hold up to to washing and reusing which makes them a great value for your money.', 'Perfect for a thick smoothies. Good quality too.', 'I bought these to enjoy popping boba drinks at home, and they’re just the right size! Some other reviews mention a poor color selection, but that wasn’t my experience. I got five different colors, and maybe a little more of one than the other four, but honestly not skewed enough that I’d have mentioned it without the other reviews.', 'I purchased these straws for an art project.', 'Plastic straws are bad for the environment, but make it so much easier to drink your drink. I love smoothies and green juice, but am not quite ready to drink it from a paper straw (gross). My favorite green juice/smoothie place started using paper straws, so I stopped going. Paper straws tend to melt in my drink as I’m drinking it.I really wanted to continue to go to the smoothie shop, but I was unsure of a good alternative to paper straws. In the end, I just purchased these plastic straws.What I love about these straws are that the 10 mm straws are very big and perfect for smoothies or milkshakes (and drinking large chunks of fruit or ice cream). I am unsure what you would use a bigger, 12 mm, straw for.In most cities, straws are not recyclable. If you are worried about plastic straws ruining the environment (a very valid concern), you can still recycle these. An easy way to recycle the straws is to put them in a container made out of polypropylene (like a milk jug). You can recycle the whole container with the straws inside it.', 'I always heard how boba straws were great to use as dowels in tiered cakes and thought this would be the best option for me since I am a beginner baker. I love them! They’re sturdy and easy to cut and it’s more than enough straws in one pack to last me for a while.', 'I love these straws! I ordered the 8mm wide straws and I have to say they are exactly what I was looking for. The diameter of the straw is the perfect size, not too narrow and not too wide. They come in a variety of bright beautiful colors. These are very well made, they do not break or crack when you squeeze or bend them. I will be purchasing them again. If you’re looking to buy some straws these are definitely a great purchase, you will not be disappointed', \"GREAT SIZE: I HAVE TMJ AND I CAN'T CHEW VERY MUCH WITHOUT CAUSING MORE PAIN IN MY JAWS. THEREFORE, I PUT MOST OF MY FOOD IN A BLENDER TO LIQUFY IT. WHEN I ADD ICE TO THE FRUIT-VEGETABLES AND GRAINS THE SMOOTHY BECOMES TOO THICK FOR ME TO SUCK UP THRU A REGULAR SIZE STRAW. THE MILKSHAKE STRAWS FROM THE STORE WERE ALSO TOO THIN FOR ME TO SUCK UP THRU COMFORTABLY. I WAS SO TICKLED TO FIND YOUR LARGER DIAMETER STRAWS. THEY WORK BEAUTIFULLY. MY JAWS A FEELING BETTER SINCE I DON'T HAVE TO USE SO MUCH FORCE WITH MY JAWS IN ORDER TO GET THE SMOOTHY INTO MY MOUTH. PS; I FORGOT TO SAY I HAVE ARTHRITIS AND FIBROMYLISIA SO DRINKING NORMALLY CAUSES TOO MUCH PAIN IN MY NECK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT.\", 'We ordered these after too many food deliveries came without a straw or only a narrow soda straw for milkshakes. These are perfect for enjoying thicker milkshakes without getting stuck mid suck on a chunky bit.', 'The only dislike I have for these straws is the length with my Vitamix blender cups. Other than that I like the very sturdy straw and thickness. I will still buy again.', 'Good size for a smoothie but disappointed with the “assortment” of colors; it’s very different than the advertised photo. My toddler likes to pick the straw for smoothie-time and it was a let down', 'The size is great for smoothies.', 'I received a good variety of colors. These are plenty big for the chunkiest of smoothies (and some frozen fruit blended into frosty adult beverages) and seem like they will last a long time. I bought some straw cleaners and will use those to hand wash them.', 'If you are using these as drink straws they are fine so this review might be a little unfair but I hoped to use them as supports for multi tiered cakes. I\\'ve heard great things about using these straws instead of wooden dowels and really wanted it to work but despite a ridiculous number of extra \"precautionary\" straws my most recent cake looked like the leaning tower by the time I got it to the destination. I\\'ve been doing cakes for a long time and that never happens with wood dowels. So if you are a caker looking for supports don\\'t use these. They are not sturdy enough. If you just need big drink straws these are awesome and you should definitely buy them. I\\'m giving the rest of the pack to my kids for smoothies and milkshakes.', \"I must admit, I don't use these as straws, but as support pieces in cakes to hold up the different tiers. There sturdiness and diameter make them perfect for this. Normally you would use dowel rods or the like, but since cakes can vary in height, having something that you can quickly take off a millimeter or 2 with scissors to make it even, is great, and something you can't easily do with plastic or wood dowels. And for the price, it is much cheaper to use these as well. So for a baker, they are perfect!\", 'My daughter loves bubble tea. We make at home and needed some new straws. I looked online and these were perfect for it. They are nice and large. Tapioca pearls fit through the straws nicely.', \"I have bought these straws a few times now. They are good quality straws. The picture is misleading however, because they are 90 percent green. I really love every color except green. The picture makes them look like they are mostly pink. I probably won't buy them again, because I am so sick of the green color.\", \"1) A lot of straws!2) Perfect for my Tupperware tumblers I use every day - they are just the right length3) Great that they are dishwasher safe but they do tend to start warping after a few runs through the dishwasher.4) But that's ok because like I said - A LOT of straws\", 'Nice.', \"I needed a thick plastic straw that measured 8 mm in diameter, so I ordered these. They are very sturdy and thick, and they are 8 mm, but I found after I got them that I actually needed 7 mm straws. There was nothing wrong with the straws, I just ordered the wrong size straw. I was going to return them and get smaller ones, but I found a way to use them anyway, so I kept them. They are very colorful and bright, and they hold up well for my purposes. I'm sure these would work very well for smoothies and milkshakes.\", \"To be honest I didn't pay much attention to the size described and just wanted a good deal and good product reviews. And not bending straws. I have a 3 yo and could not wait until she goes thru a box of regular bending straws: each drinking session would result in dripping milk all over the table from bent down straws and I just had enough. This looked like a perfect match: straight straws, good price for the quantity and good reviews. But when they arrived I was pleasantly shocked! They are thick! And we love them! My kids are crazy about them, we don't really drink smoothies, but they are just fun to use. And my 3 yo picks her color, comments on the size and finishes her drink without spilling or spitting or anything. I am never coming back to the regular straws. Please don't discontinue them!\", 'Thick milk shakes!', 'These are perfect for my 2yo daughter - I give her juice containers still intact and just poke a straw through the foil or whatever is sealing drinks typically made for kids.

They were shipped in a box which ensured they would not be smashed, rather than just a bubble mailer. The straws themselves are of very good quality, and colorful. Thank you ALINK.', \"The size is perfect! It's a great size for boba!\", 'I use these as “pencil holders” in my 2nd grade classroom where the floor used to be covered in pencils daily. These have significantly decreased the amount of pencils rolling off of desks and falling on the floor. The only downfall is if something heavy is set on them they will crack. But I make 3 pencil holders out of one straw so they are easy to untape and retape. Plus the colors are super cute! I’m very happy with this purchase! I would say that I will be a repeat customer, but with SO MANY straws it’ll be a long time before I will need to rebuy.', 'These are great! Kinda pricey but I’m used to buying them at the dollar store. These are your $ store straws though they are thick!!

The straws are flat on both ends- they do not have the pointed end that some bubble tea straws have.All in all, these are fine. They will work for my green smoothies.', \"My husband and I are on a major smoothie drinking streak. We're obsessed - especially now that we can drink up our smoothies with these thick straws! High quality and WELL worth the cost. These are inexpensive, but I haven't had a single one crack on me (I bought smoothie straws from a different seller on Amazon, and they must have been old. Every single straw would get a crack in it if it was bent AT ALL.) I'd recommend these to anyone and EVERYONE! Makes smoothies so much more fun!\", 'I ordered these because of their short height and wide opening. My granddaughters like short straws, and they drink a lot of smoothies. I have even cut these shorter. They cut easily. I have washed them by hand and reused the same ones several times. They are not hard plastic, but I imagine they will last quite awhile. Plus, you get 100. My granddaughters chew the ends of the hard plastic straws until they crack. These are much more flexible. I have not tried washing them in the dishwasher. My guess is that they would survive the wash, but not the heated dry.', 'These straws are perfect to use with boba tea. They suck up the boba with no effort. Perfect size, and VERY sturdy.', \"I use these straws for boba teas and smoothies! I like that they don't have a chemical plastic-y taste (which I've experienced before unfortunately) but these seem not to leech into my drink.A little note, however, if you are intending to buy these straws to puncture the top of a sealed boba drink (like in tea shops) the ends of these straws are not pointy! This also means you have to lift the straw a bit off the bottom of the cup to prevent making your drink into a vacuum commercial.

I can now really enjoy my smoothie and it is so nice when something you purchase is received quickly, provides correct functionality with an efficient supplier/shop!', 'Rating straws seems a bit silly, but incase you are wondering these are great. My daughters love to drink out of straws. So i decided this is the way to go. We had some metal ones that you had to clean out all the time, and some others that were a thick plastic, also thought to be recycled, These just make things a little easier. My child will use it for the day and then throw them out. I feel it cuts down on any possible germs or drink being left on the straw when you try to reuse.', 'These were exactly what i was looking for, they work great for any drink!', 'I ordered these because I have taken to making smoothies at home! They work great and solve all of my smoothie drinking problems!', 'I have now ordered these straws twice. I previously was using washable straws with my Ninja cups for protein shakes in the morning, but never felt like the straw was getting fully clean each time, which led me to Amazon to seek an alternative. The hole in these is large enough to easily allow thicker protein shakes to pass through and are tall enough for use even with my largest accessory cup. Plus, the cheery colors are a bright start to the day! Will definitely keep purchasing!', 'The real deal, these brightly colored durable straws are perfect for all drinks including smoothies and thick shakes. They hold up to children’s biting and still pull liquid. They don’t become soggy over the long haul and although can be reused with cleaning are priced so as to be considered disposable.

I didn't even know these extra large straws existed until I got one at a yuppie smoothie shop. I make a smoothie every single morning and I like them thick. I've been sucking them through a puny little straw for years. These are the best and they don't get clogged with ice or fruit. My friends think I'm over reacting when I tell them how cool these are but when they see how practical they are in real life, they become a believer too! I bought 100 of them and will buy another 100 when these are gone!!\", 'I love this product I am a home baker and love decorating cakes. My deck cakes always need support the Alink straws gives this perfect support cuts my time in half, because they are easy to cut to size and are the perfect width.

The only complaint I have is the fact that they don't have a slanted edge on the bottom, like typical boba straws you find at the shops, and that only a few of the straws are translucent.

I was hesitant since my brand is \"green\" and single use plastics are a no-no, but I was pleasantly surprised at how durable they are. As long as you don\\'t chew on them you should be able to use them a few times. I just used the brush that came with my silicone straws to clean them and spritzed them with isopropyl alcohol and let them dry and they were good to go. They\\'ll be reusable for my purposes for quite a while. If you\\'re concerned about single use plastics but don\\'t want to invest in silicone or stainless steel straws, give these a try. They won\\'t last forever but they\\'re certainly sturdier than the usual throw away straws.', 'In NJ in 2022, a plastic straw restriction was pat into law., so we\\'re pretty much stuck with paper straws now.

These fit the bill. 5/16\" or 8mm diameter is what to get if you want a straw like that. They are hard to find. I spent a lot of time searching.

We kept discussing how places should offer wider straws for shakes, and kept saying we would watch out for some in-store.I decided to look on here, and after researching, these sounded & looked the widest.

We hate the paper bags, as they are difficult to carry and we can only carry one at a time in from the car. Not like the plastic where you could carry many at one time. And if you have to go up to the 2nd or 3rd floor, that is a lot of trips. These cloth bags are strong, and you can carry many at one time, as you could with the plastic. They are nice looking and strong, and can be folded up to a very small package if you want. They can fit right in your purse, glove compartment, or pocket. I have the gingham look ones (very pretty), which I leave in my car, and my husband had chosen the black. Then he thought he would like the blue, (which he does), so I came back and bought the blue. He keeps them in his car for if he stops at the market. We are now all set and don't have to use the paper anymore. We just love these bags and believe they will last for a long time. Also, very nice company to do business with. Nice people.
